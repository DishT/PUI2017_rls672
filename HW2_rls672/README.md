Assignment 1: Tracking Each Vehicle for a Line

I initially struggled with this, as I had never written a script or dealt with APIs or JSONs. I was struggling to get the URL correctly set up with the mta key and bus ref. 
  
Dana showed me her code, which helped in getting started. 

That plus the inclass api/script examples helped me understand the syntax/structure. 

I spent time looking through the JSON (using a web-based JSON viewer) to understand the structure of the data. It then made a lot more sense how it 
related to Python dictionaries and consequently how to pull certain data. 

I first wrote the script using a Jupyter notebook, to be able to check along the way what worked/didn't work. I then transferred it to a script, changing the necessary
elements (adding sys.argv, etc). 


Assignment 2: Next Stop Info

After having done assignment 1, this one was easier. The biggest hurdle was figuring out how to include a 'N/A' condition for OnwardCalls. 

After googling, I found the 'if not' function to check for empty data. 

I used the provided lab example for learning how to write to a csv. 


Assignment 3: Read CSV files with Pandas 

This assignment wasn't too hard by following the instructions given (esp. being in the right kernel). Having worked with pandas before in UCSL, I was
familiar with most of the concepts. 

I referenced the class example (Formatting Tables) to understand how to use os.getenv. 

I had to do some googling to check some of the plotting syntax. 


Extra Credit

This was more or less the same as assignment 3. The main difference was adding in datetime variables and working with them in pandas. 

For plotting, I selected a singular month of data (out of ~5 years) for ease.
