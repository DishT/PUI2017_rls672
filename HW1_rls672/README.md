Assignment 1: Finish Lab 

Purpose/Learning Goals: To learn how to create and manage a git repo with Github. 

Process: I followed instructions laid out in Prof. Bianco's github (Lab1_fb55). 



Assignment 2: Set Up Environment 

Purpose/Learning Goals: To correctly and efficiently set up environment using an environmental variable and an alias. 

Process: 

1) I created a directory called PUI2017 using mkdir 
2) Environmental variable & alias creation 
	a)I created an environmental variable using 'export'. This tells the machine that PUI2017 means the given file path. 
	b) I created an alias using 'alias'.  This tells the machine when I type 'pui2017' to change directory to the path specified in the environmental variable.
