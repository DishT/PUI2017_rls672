**Assignment 1**

I worked with Dana, Sarah, Emily, and Matt to get started, particularly in understanding what to put in 'narray.' Then I revised it on my own and played with the sample/population sizes to see the impact. Sarah showed me how she fit her line and I did some googling on my own as well. 



**Assignment 2**

I worked with Dana, Emily, and Matt collaboratively as we worked through the skeleton notebook. 

I read the scipy documentation and did some googling to better understand the H0 and when you can/can't reject. 


**Assignment 3**

I worked with Dana & Emily. Dana was helpful in helping me merge the data. 

The plotting wasn't too bad, but I struggled with the model portion. In addition to stackoverflow/google, I referenced and heavily relied on https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2017_fb55/blob/master/Lab5_fb55/line_fit_and_residuals.ipynb
